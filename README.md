# Swiper Text Editor

This project is a small web app that lets you add and edit text on top of images inside a vertical Swiper slider.
You can move the text around, change its style, and even add multiple text layers on each image — similar to basic story or poster editors.

I built this using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks.

## Why I made this

This project was created to practice:
